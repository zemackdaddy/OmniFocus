# OmniFocus

* gotolink.scpt
This [post](https://jesse.hollington.ca/2016/05/getting-focused-with-omnifocus.html) by Jesse Hollington includes AppleScript to open a URL within a Task's notes.  As far as I could tell, it only opens the first URL it finds.  I am not a great "scripter", but I wanted it to open all URLs found in a Task's notes; but hold on because I am even harder to please!  I wanted any OmniFocus URLs to open in new tabs (depends on your System Preferences > Dock settings).
